# Once Upon a Time... 
This project was thought to approach dads, moms, sons, daughters, grandpas, grandmas, and whole family to dream and tell stories together and learn more about the catholic saints as well. You can live family stories again and count with images so your toddler see some of your memories. Remember, the main object of this project it's to provide images for your stories, but **you** will tell the stories (We always will be humans ðŸ¥² ). There is a special session to choose a saint story and teach more for your kid.
